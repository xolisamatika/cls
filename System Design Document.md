## Courier Logistics System Design Document

### 1. Overview
   This document outlines the design of a Courier Logistics System that manages operations related to shipment tracking, 
   courier assignments, and overall logistics management. The system is built to handle large-scale operations, 
   ensuring efficient handling and tracking of shipments.

### 2. High-Level Architecture Diagram
   The system architecture is divided into several key components, each responsible for specific functionalities. 
   Below is a high-level architecture diagram:

### 3. Choice of Technologies and Frameworks

- Programming Language: Java 17
- Framework: Spring Boot 3.3.3
- Spring Web: For building RESTful web services.
- Spring Data JPA: For database interactions.
- Spring Security: For securing the API endpoints using JWT.
- Spring Boot Actuator: For monitoring and managing the application.
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Chosen for its robustness, support for complex queries, and ACID compliance.
- Messaging Queue: RabbitMQ (optional, for asynchronous processing)
- Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (K8s)
- API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI
- Testing: JUnit 5, Mockito
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.

### 4. Explanation of Component Interactions
#### API Gateway:

- Responsibility: Acts as the single entry point for all client requests. Routes requests to the appropriate microservices and handles authentication and rate limiting.
- Interaction: Receives HTTP requests, forwards them to the Shipment Service or Courier Service, and returns the response to the client.

#### Authentication Service:

- Responsibility: Manages user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. Ensures that only authenticated users can access the API.
- Interaction: Validates incoming requests, attaches user context, and forwards valid requests to other services.

#### Shipment Service:

- Responsibility: Manages shipment creation, updates, and tracking. Assigns shipments to available couriers based on location and capacity.
- Interaction: Interacts with the Courier Service to find available couriers and updates the database with shipment details.

#### Courier Service:

- Responsibility: Manages courier information, including location updates and capacity management.
- Interaction: Works with the Shipment Service to assign couriers to shipments and update their status.

#### Database (PostgreSQL):

- Responsibility: Stores all persistent data, including shipments, couriers, and user information.
- Interaction: Accessed by Shipment Service and Courier Service for CRUD operations. Ensures data integrity through ACID transactions.

### 5. Strategies for Handling Failures and Ensuring Data Integrity

- #### 1. Database Transactions:

  * Strategy: Use ACID-compliant transactions in PostgreSQL to ensure data consistency and integrity. Each operation that affects the state of multiple entities (e.g., assigning a shipment to a courier) should be wrapped in a transaction.

- #### 2. Retry and Circuit Breaker Patterns:

   * Strategy: Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures (e.g., network issues) and use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures. Spring Retry and Resilience4j can be utilized for these patterns.

- #### 3. Asynchronous Processing:

  * Strategy: Use RabbitMQ for asynchronous tasks like sending notifications or processing background tasks. This helps in decoupling services and improving system resilience.

- #### 5. API Gateway Rate Limiting:

  * Strategy: Implement rate limiting at the API Gateway level to protect the system from abuse and ensure fair usage of resources.

- #### 6. Logging and Monitoring:

  * Strategy: Use Spring Boot Actuator for application monitoring and integrate with centralized logging solutions like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Monitor key metrics and set up alerts for abnormal behavior.

- #### 6. Data Backup and Recovery:

  * Strategy: Regularly back up the PostgreSQL database and test recovery procedures. Ensure that backups are encrypted and stored securely.

- #### 7. Graceful Degradation:

  * Strategy: Design the system to degrade gracefully in the event of partial failures. For example, if the Courier Service is down, allow the Shipment Service to continue operating with limited functionality.

- #### 9. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

  * Strategy: Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate testing and deployment. Ensure that all changes pass through unit tests, integration tests, and code quality checks before being deployed to production.
